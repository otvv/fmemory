A simple node add-on for reading and writing memory on GNU/Linux.

<details>
<summary>more info:</summary>
<h4>features:</h4>

  - memory reading
  - memory writing
  - get process id through process name
  - get module base address through module name
  - get call address offset
  - get the absolute location of an address (get absolute address)
  
<h4>todo:</h4>

  - vector3d and vector2d support _(read, write)_
  - ability to call virtual functions
  - shellcode execution _(maybe)_
  - high privileges helpers
  - signature reader/scanner

ðŸš§ _more to come.._

<h4>installing:</h4>

Since this is a Node addon, you'll need `cmake-js`, `node-addon-api`, and a C++ compiler (`GCC` or `clang`).

To install this addon simply type: `npm install fmemory` (if you get an error related to cmake-js, make sure your node.js is updated to the latest version and also make sure that `node-addon-api` and `cmake-js` are installed globally first.)

<h4>usage:</h4>

The usage is pretty straight-forward.

Here's how:

```javascript
const fmemory = require("fmemory");

const clientStateAddress = 0xDEADBEEF
const deltaTickOffset = 0x123

const main = (() => {

  // get process id
  const processID = fmemory.getProcessID("csgo_linux64")

  // get engine module base address
  const engineModuleBaseAddress = fmemory.getModuleBaseAddress("engine_client.so", processID)

  // get client state address
  const pClientState = fmemory.readMemory(engineModuleBaseAddress + clientStateAddress, fmemory.INT)

  if (pClientState) {

    // force update
    fmemory.writeMemory(pClientState + deltaTickOffset, -1 /* <- value */, fmemory.BYTE)
  }

})()
```

_NOTE_: This works with Wine/Proton as well.
_(Still needs improvement on that area, but it works.)_

<h4>documentation:</h4>

When using the `writeMem` or `readMem` you will need to tell the data type parameter, it can either be a `string`:

```javascript
"int32", "uint32", "int64",
"uint64", "long", "ulong", 
"short", "float", "double", 
"byte", "bool" "string",
"pointer"
```

Or you can use one of the constants provided by the library:

```javascript
fmemory.INT, fmemory.UINT, fmemory.INT64,
fmemory.UINT64, fmemory.LONG, fmemory.ULONG, 
fmemory.SHORT, fmemory.FLOAT, fmemory.DOUBLE,
fmemory.BYTE, fmemory.BOOL, fmemory.STRING,
fmemory.POINTER
```
